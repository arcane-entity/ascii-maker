 This is an application capable of creating ascii art from your drawings! 
 To run the app, you will need to have Tkinter, Pillow, and Pygame installed. 
 After running the app, you can begin drawing. I'd recommend choosing between light mode or dark mode before starting your drawing. 
 Light mode will fill the background with darker ascii characters and the drawing with lighter ones.
 Dark mode will work the opposite way, as seen in the logo in this file.
 You have the option change the color used which will result in different ascii characters filling the drawing.
 You can also change the line thickness levels, but due to Pygame's limitations, when using very thick lines, the line might appear broken.
 If this happens, consider moving the cursor slower and going back to fill in any remaining gaps.
 Saving will generate a .jpg file, as well as a .txt with the ascii art. To view it, make sure to put Notepad on fullscreen to see the file in it's entirety!
